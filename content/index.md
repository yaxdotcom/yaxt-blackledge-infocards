The web has matured and lost its luster, and sadly we’ve matured too, weighed down by complacency and resignation, believing that the Internet’s disappointments are inevitable, a product of unseen and inexorable forces. Our shining utopia need not yield to a dystopian darkness. The Internet is the result of human thought and hands. General AI is not yet the lord of our Internet; we need not prematurely disavow our role as originators of the Internet experience. To assume the Internet is anything else is to deny human agency.

We can say that we are disillusioned and the Internet has failed to fulfill its promise; we can fear that the Golden Age we anticipated is actually the decline of our era; but here I’m saying we can take up the tools and practices that will shape the web we desire. It’s our choice.

Tech writing often requires a code block:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

And links are important, too: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
